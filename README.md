# Nail-detection-B-W
Here I compiled code for nails detection in black and white images.

YoloV5 based architecture was used to train on a custom dataset of 350 photographs of hands taken using Thorlabs CS135MUS monochrome  CMOS camera.
Algorithm was specifically made for my project for using Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging technique for non-invasive hemoglobin measurements using diffusely reflected light from nail beds at different spatial frequencies.
